# Introduction

Prism60 is a stacked acrylic case for universal "poker-size" 60% PCBs. The acrylic stacks are held together by standoffs and screws. The idea is to make a very accesible and cheap version of a 60% case that can be sourced locally virtually anywhere.

The case is comprised of four layers of acrylic:

- Bottom layer (5mm)
- Two mid layers: one with a cutout for the USB connector (5mm tchickness) and the other one without the cutout (4mm thickness), the latter having identical cutting profile to the Top layer albeit with different thickness;
- Switch plate layer (1.5mm)
- Top layer (5mm).

Hence the layers stack up measuring, from top to bottom: 5-1.5-4-5-5 .The layers thickesses can be customized to adjust height, but it is recommended to keep the switch plate layer at 1.5mm so that MX-style switches will latch onto the plate. It is also recommended to keep the middle layers at their rated thickness so that the USB connector is centered to the cutout. Thicknesses of the bottom and top layers are free. The top layer covers the switch bodies; to make a lower profile exposed switch case, one can simply not use the top layer. Alternatively, one can also use thinner bottom plates; at least 1mm is advisable.

The files are offered in Inkscape SVG format. Familiarity with Inkscape is advised. It is also important to note that the files contain exact measurements and sizes; to see those, turn the respective layers to visible through the layers menu (Ctrl + Shift + L).
